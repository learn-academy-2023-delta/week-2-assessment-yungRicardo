# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: a parameter is variable passed in a function when it is being declared and an argument is value of some sorts passed in function when it is being called.

Researched answer: The difference between parameters and arguments: Function paramaters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Paramters are intialized to the values of the arguments supplied. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The required parameter in a .map () is the callback and it accepts a value within the array. The opttional parameter would be the index of the value

Researched answer: The map.() method takes one required parameter and an optional second parameter. The required parameter being the callback value and the optional parameters being the index and the array.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: A .map() returns an array with values changed the function and filter returns an array with elements paasing condtion given.

Researched answer: map.() creates a new array by transforming each element based on a provided function and filter() creates a new array by selecting only the elements that satisfy a specified condition.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: excutes a block code back to back until condtion is met on an element

Researched answer: 
Iteration in JavaScript refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code or performing a set of instructions multiple times. It allows you to iterate over a collection of data or repeat a specific action until a certain condition is met.

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function is a block of code that can be called by its name and can accept parameters and return a value. A method is a function that is associated with an object or a class.

Researched answer: A function is a set of instructions or procedures to perform a specific task, and a method is a set of instructions that are associated with an object.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: is process where the interpreter moves the declaration of functions or variables to the top of their scope.

Researched answer: 
Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior that allows variable and function declarations to be moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that regardless of where the declarations are actually placed in the code, they are conceptually moved to the top.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

2. Spread operator: spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React state: The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.

4. React props: props stands for properties, which refers to the properties of an object. This is because all elements created in React are JavaScript objects. As a result, passing data into a component is done by creating properties and values for the object.

5. DOM events: allow JavaScript to add event listener or event handlers to HTML elements.
